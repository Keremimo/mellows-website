        <h1>Requirements to join our Mellowship!</h1>
        <h4 style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 200px">
          The Mellow Fellows are a very laid back team full of amazing streamers
          from all areas of Twitch! If you’d like to join us we do have a few
          requirements for team members and things we generally look for.
        </h4>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="listing">
      <ul>
        <li>
          Be an active streamer. We’re looking for creators who are broadcasting
          on a regular basis. Usually at least once a week!
        </li>
        <li>
          Some general experience on Twitch. Make sure you have some time with
          streaming under your belt! Find your voice with your stream before
          applying. That doesn’t mean if you’re newer that you shouldn’t apply
          but we generally like streamers who have at least a few months of
          active experience on the team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have your VoDs available for us to review. Having VoDs on subscriber
          only or having none saved doesn’t give us much to work with when
          evaluating your channel.
        </li>
        <li>
          Discord. We have a team discord that we ask all members join. This is
          how we communicate with each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be a more relaxed stream. Our stream is all about having Mellow vibes.
          While on occasion we all get a bit tilted, we’re looking for streamers
          who are generally relaxed with their content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Be willing to interact with your team. Everyone has their own schedule
          and gets busy but we want members who have time to stop by other
          streams on occasion to say “Hi” or interact on our team Discord.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mention the team in a panel. Your page will always be your page but we
          would like all members have a panel or a brief sentence somewhere in
          an existing panel about the team!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <h4>What we can offer you!</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>An amazing group of streamers to network and collaborate with.</li>
        <li>Likely chance of hosts & raids from other team members.</li>
        <li>
          Promotion for your stream on our teams twitter (<a
            href="https://x.com/mellowfellowstv"
            target="_blank"
            >@mellowfellowstv</a
          >). If you follow our Twitter this usually means clips on occasion,
          promotion for any major streams you do and that sweet “Happy Birthday”
          Tweet!
        </li>
        <li>
          Your name listed on our Twitch Team page for viewers to discover your
          sweet mellow vibes in!
        </li>
        <li>
          Be able to participate in any major projects the team is doing such as
          Charity Events.
        </li>
        <li>
          Appearances on our teams YouTube channel (Clip Shows, Multiplayer
          sessions with the team, Podcasts)
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of the day however, nothing is a guarantee with a team. A
          team is what you’re able to make of it. If you join, interact with us
          and try to be a part you’ll likely have an amazing experience and make
          some awesome new friends but we can’t promise anything in terms of
          channel growth. We all work hard together to be the best creators that
          we can be.
        </li>
